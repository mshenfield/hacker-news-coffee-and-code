# Hacker News Coffee and Conversation
Follow a conversation between two users on Hacker News.  Popular Hacker News articles can become so bogged down with comments it is hard to track down and follow a single thread of conversation. This simple extension (which only works on Hacker News articles, items, and comments), adds an option to only show responses and posts from a comment author and the author of the comment they responded to.
